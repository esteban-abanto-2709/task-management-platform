# ⚙️ Backend TODO - TaskFlow API

> **Status**: MVP Complete ✅  
> **Focus**: Critical fixes only before moving to next project

---

## 🎯 MVP Completion Checklist

### ✅ Core Features (DONE)

- [x] User authentication (register/login)
- [x] JWT implementation
- [x] Project CRUD
- [x] Task CRUD
- [x] Task status workflow
- [x] Protected routes
- [x] Validation with class-validator
- [x] Database relationships (User → Projects → Tasks)

## 🔥 CRITICAL - Must Fix Before CV Upload

### 1. Environment Variables ⚠️

- [ ] **Add `.env.example` validation**
  - Document all required env vars in README
  - Verify app fails gracefully if vars missing
- [ ] **Secure JWT Secret**
  - Ensure JWT_SECRET is not hardcoded anywhere
  - Add warning in console if using default secret

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes  
**Why**: Security best practice, prevents obvious mistakes

---

### 2. API Documentation 📄

- [ ] **Add basic endpoint documentation**
  - Update README.md with all endpoints
  - Include request/response examples
  - Document authentication headers

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour  
**Why**: Essential for anyone reviewing your code (recruiters, etc.)

## 🧹 Quick Cleanup Tasks

### Code Quality (Optional, but recommended)

- [ ] Remove any `console.log()` statements
- [ ] Fix ESLint warnings (currently some are set to 'warn')
- [ ] Add missing JSDoc comments to public methods
- [ ] Verify no unused imports

**Priority**: LOW  
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour  
**Why**: Code cleanliness, shows attention to detail

---

### Testing (Post-MVP, if time allows)

- [ ] Add at least ONE test file as example
  - `auth.service.spec.ts` - test user creation
  - Shows you know how to write tests
  - Even 1 test is better than none for CV purposes

**Priority**: LOW (nice-to-have)  
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours  
**Why**: Demonstrates testing knowledge

---

## 📊 Production Readiness (Post-CV Upload)

**These are for AFTER you've moved on, if you come back to this project**:

### Security Enhancements

- [ ] Rate limiting with `@nestjs/throttler`
- [ ] Helmet.js for security headers
- [ ] CORS strict configuration for production
- [ ] Input sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention audit

### Performance

- [ ] Database indexing strategy
- [ ] Query optimization
- [ ] Pagination implementation
- [ ] Caching layer (Redis)

### Architecture

- [ ] Repository pattern implementation
- [ ] Separate permission guards/services
- [ ] Global interceptors for logging
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Database migrations strategy

### Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for all services
- [ ] E2E tests for critical flows
- [ ] 70%+ code coverage

## ✅ Definition of "Done" for MVP

**The API is CV-ready when**:

1. ✅ All core features work (they do)
2. ✅ No critical security issues (JWT is fine)
3. ✅ Environment variables documented
4. ✅ README has clear setup instructions
5. ✅ Error handling is consistent
6. ✅ Code is clean (no obvious console.logs or commented code)

**Current Status**: 5/6 complete

**Remaining Time to "Done"**: 2-3 hours max

---

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### Minimal Path (2 hours)

1. Verify `.env.example` is complete (15 min)
2. Document all API endpoints in README (45 min)
3. Quick error handling audit (30 min)
4. Remove console.logs, fix ESLint warnings (30 min)

### If you have extra time (1 more hour)

1. Add ONE example test file (1 hour)

### Then STOP and move to next project ✋
